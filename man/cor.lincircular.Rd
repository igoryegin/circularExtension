\title{
Linear-Circular Correlation
}
\description{
Performs correlation analysis for two vectors, one circular and one linear. 
}
\usage{
cor.lincircular(lvar, cvar, method = c("jwm", "rank"), p.value = c("asymptotic", "simulated"))
}

\arguments{
  \item{lvar}{
  vector with a linear variable
}
  \item{cvar}{
  vector with a circular variable
}
  \item{method}{
  test type. By default, Johnson-Wehrly-Mardia test of circular-linear association is performed. If \code{"rank"} is selected, the function will perform Mardia's rank correlation test.
}
  \item{p.value}{
  method of calculating the p-value. If \code{simulated}, a Monte Carlo p-value with 9,999 simulations is provided.
}
}
\details{
Johnson-Wehrly-Mardia correlation coefficient \eqn{R^2} is always between 0 and 1. For statistical inference, we use the fact that, under \eqn{H_0}, the test statistic \eqn{F = \frac{n - 3}{2}\times{\frac{R^2}{1 - R^2}}} is approximated by F-distribution with 2 and n - 3 degrees of freedom.

Likewise, Mardia's test statistic \eqn{U = \frac{24(T^2_c + T^2_s)}{n^2(n+1)}} has Chi-square distribution with 2 degrees of freedom.
